Pre-Configured Application Template for CakePHP 3

## Installation

This is just a brief installation guide. A much more detailed version will be available soon:

Use composer to install the package:

`$ composer create-project scherersoftware/cake-app-template <project-name>`

Stuff like MySQL user and password is configured by using PHP Dotenv.
Be sure to set `SESSION_COOKIE_NAME` and `MAIN_DOMAIN` in the `.env`, as these values are mandatory for a correct session setup.

Next, setup your database. We're using cakephp/migrations for that:

`$ bin/cake migrations migrate`

Also run the migrations from Josegonzalez/CakeQueuesadilla, as we use this plugin to send out the restore password emails.

`$ bin/cake migrations migrate -p Josegonzalez/CakeQueuesadilla`

For the ModelHistory you have to run these migrations:

`$ bin/cake migrations migrate -p ModelHistory`

Now seed the database with a default user

`$ bin/cake migrations seed`

Default email: `john.doe@example.com`, default password: `password`

Be sure to have `npm` installed and make sure afterwards `bower` is installed globally:

```
$ npm install -g bower
```

Now we have to install some npm packages and the bower dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

Install the bower dependencies:

`$ bower install`
